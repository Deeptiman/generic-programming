## Golang Generic

// https://go.dev/play/p/d277nCZRUX5

- Golang releases generic programming with a specific goal for developers to write common set of types
to utilize as types parameters for functions and type struct. The syntax to write generic type comes
with a `func F[T any] (p T){ ... }` that can be use to declare common types and the function arguments 
will use the set of types as parameters. Also, types can have type parameters list `type O[T any] struct`. 
We'll see the more examples on syntax of generic structure in the course of this article.

Why Generic types in Golang is so important?

can utilize to write singular reusable code.

to define a set of types with type parameters and type inference.
